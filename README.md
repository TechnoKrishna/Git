# Git

💡 What Does Git Mean?
Git is a Version Control System (VCS) — it helps you track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and manage multiple versions of your project easily.

📘 Simple Definition:
Git is like a time machine for your code.
It remembers every change you make and lets you go back, compare, or even work on different versions at once.
